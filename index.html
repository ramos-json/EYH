  <h1 style="text-align: center; color: green;">The Task</h1>
  <p>Your task is to design a robot (or series of robots) to assist in the demolition of a large scale building. This robot could be multi-purpose or concentrate on a particular task such as the removal of steel frames, concrete walls/floors, glass, insulations or hazardous materials (e.g. asbestos).You should first investigate typical building materials used in large scale projects, and consider any hazards based on their prior use (e.g. an industrial plant which used hazardous chemicals, or a medical lab which used radioactive isotopes). You should select a specific installation, consider its unique problems, and develop a deconstruction plan using robots. In order to make this plan viable you should consider what benefits come from this approach compared to traditional methods, including safety, time and costs.



  </p><p><br> In addition you could also include the following; your design should consider how the value of the materials can be maintained, for possible re-use (selling on) after deconstruction, and how you would advise the building industry on changes to building design to facilitate the future use and re-use of materials using the efficient dismantling techniques employed by your robots..</p>
  <h2 style="color: green;">Considerations</h2>
  <ul>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>Fundamental concept</li></h3>
     <p>You should first identify the scope of your design, the building type/style, materials, hazards, access and control. For a large scale unique project a bespoke solution could be economic, or for a more generic build you should consider the ability to adapt the robot to a series of similar buildings.</p>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>Access</li></h3>
     <p>Consider access to the site as well as the height of the building. The location may mean you have limited air space on the four sides of the building, and the height of the building may require careful consideration of the removal of waste. If your initial concept is only adapted for a low rise building, try and consider how it could be changed to access multiple floors, and high rise blocks.</p>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>People</li></h3>
     <p>Although the robots will replace some of the labour required, there could still be a requirement for people to be on the site. Take into account how the two might interact and consider any health and safety measures that should be implemented.</p>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>Environmental Controls</li></h3>
     <p>Ideally, robots could work through the night, reducing deconstruction times. However, local authorities might restrict on site hours to reduce complaints about noise at night, particularly in residential areas. Could this be overcome using robots? How might you convince local authorities that robot use will reduce noise and lighting levels at night? Furthermore, how can you ensure your robots can work in all weather conditions?</p>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>Cost Benefit Analysis</li></h3>
     <p>Are there any disadvantages to using robots? Consider how you would demonstrate the value of the project to industry.</p>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>Future Proofing</li></h3>
     <p>The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) is becoming more common [2] and will require construction professions to produce an architectural model, a structural model and a services model. These are then linked together to provide a whole building solution. How might BIM technology affect the use of robots in the deconstruction process?</p>
     <h3 style="color: green;"> <li>Sustainability</li></h3>
     <p>Consider how this solution is future-proofed, and minimizes any detriment to future generations</p>
